Python Notes
Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex.

as long as this environment is active, any libraries you install will be installed on in the dsfs environment

As a matter of good discipline, you should always work in a virtual environment, and never using the “base” Python installation.

when writing python you should always use spaces, never tabs!
can use backslash \ to indicate that a stamens continues onto the next line. 
IPython has a magic function called %paste, which correctly pastes whatever is on your clipboard. 

import re
my_regex = re.compile(“[0-9]+” , re.I)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(...)

from collections import defaultdict, Counter
Don't import the entire contents of a module because you might overwrite variables you've already defined.

python functions are first-class, we can assign them to variables and pass them into functions 

Most people recommend using def for lambdas instead of assigning them to variables. 

Function parameters can be give default arguments.
def my_print(message = "my default message"):

def full_name(first = "What's-his-name", last = "Something):
    return first + " " + last
full_name(last="Grus") # "What 's-his-name Grus"

Python uses backslashes to encode special characters 
such as tab_string = "\t"

If you want backslashes as backslashes you can use not_tab_string = r"\t"

f-string is a simple way to substitute values into strings
first_name = "Joel"
last_name = "Grus"
we can do full_name1 = full_name + " " + last_name       #string.addition 
OR full_name2 = "{0} {1}".format(first_name, last_name) #string.format
finally full_name3 = f"{first_name} {last_name}" #VERY EASY!!! much less unwiedly

Most fundamental data structure in Python is the list, ordered collection. (siilar to array in Java)
integer_list [1,2,3]
heterogenous_list = ["string", 0.1, True]
list_of_lists = [integer_list, heterogenous_list, []]
list_length = len(integer_list)
list_sum = sum(integer_list)

x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
nine = x[-1]
x[0] =  -1 # x is now [-1, 1, 2...]

slicing i:j inclusive of elements from i to j (not inclusive)
leaving out the start of the slice, you'll slice the beginning of the list.
leaving out the end of the slice, you'll slice until the end of the list. 
first_three = x[:3]
three_to_end = x[3:]
one_to_four = x[1:5]
last_three = x[-3:]
without_first_and_last = x[1:-1]
copy_of_x = x[:]

slices can have a third argument to indicate its strike, which can be neagtive:
every_third = x[::3] #[-1, 3, 6, 9]
five_to_three = x[5:2:-1]

can use in operator to check for list memebership 
1 in [1,2,3] #true, checking list one at a time. Pretty slow unless list is small

concatenating lists together we can use extend
x=[1,2,3]
x.extend([4,5,6])
Don't want to modify x? use list addition
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x + [4,5,6] #leaves x unchanged

x = [1,2, 3]
x.append(0) # x is now [1,2,3, 0]
can unpack lists when you know how many elements they contain
x, y = [1, 2] x is now 1, y is now 2
if both sides don't ahve the same number of elements on both sides then it will give a ValueError
common idiom meaning words or phrases that aren't meant to be taken literary
_, y = [1, 2] # y == 2, don't care about the first element

Tuples are lists immutable cousin
you can do anything to a tuple like you can to a list that doesn't involve modifying it
specify a tuple by using parentheses (or nothing) instead of square brackets. 
my_list = [1, 2]
my_tuple = (1, 2)
other_tuple = 3, 4
empty_tuple = () or 
emptyTuple = tuple()

Use tuples to return multiple values from functions
def sum_and_product(x, y):
    return (x + y ), (x * y)
sp = sum_and_product(2, 3) #will return (5,6)
x, p = sum_and_product(5, 10 ) # will return s is 15, p is 50

Tuples and lists can also be used for multiple assignment:
x, y = 1, 2 # now x is 1, y is 2
x, y = y, x #Pythonic way to swap variables: now x is 2 and y is 1

Dictionaries associates values with keys and allow you to quickly retrieve the value corresponding to a given key. 
empty_dict = {} #Pythonic
empty_dict2 = dict() # less Pythonic
grades = {"Joel" : 80, "Tim" : 95 } #dictionary literal 

looking up value for a key using square brackets 
joels_grade = grades["Joel"]
#will get KeyError if you ask for a key that's not in the dictionary 
try:
    kates_grade = grades["Kate"]
except KeyError:
    print("no grade for kate!")

checking for existence of a key using in:
joel_has_grade = "Joel" in grades #true
#checking this way is fast even for large dictionaries. 

Dictionaries has a get method that returns a default value when you look up a key thats not in the dictionary:
joels_grade = grades.get("Joel", 0) #equals 80
kates_grade = grades.get("Kate", 0) #equals 0
no_ones_grade = grades.get("No One") #default is None

reassigning key/value pairs 
grades["Tim"] = 99   #replaces the old value
grades["Kate"] = 100 #adds a third entry
num_students = len(grades)


#not the best approach theres a better one!
tweet = {
    "user" : "joelgrus",
    "text" : "Data Science is Awesome",
    "retweet_count" : 100,
    "hashtags" : ["#data", "#science", "#datascience", "#awesome", "#yolo"]
}

tweet_keys = tweet.keys()       #iterable for the keys #iterable means an object that can be iterated over such as in a for-loop
tweet_values = tweet.values()
tweet_items = tweet.items()
